# Bayesian Analysis of Climate Data

This project applies Bayesian inference methods to analyze climate time series data.

## Methodology

We used the Stan framework to implement Bayesian hierarchical models.

## Results

The model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to classical frequentist approaches.
